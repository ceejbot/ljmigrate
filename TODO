TODO

- Interview-style configuration if config file not found or bad.
- Bad bug with generating the html index file on subsequent runs-- it will
  nuke the existing content. 
- After-the-fact html generation for existing archives.
- Use local archive to migrate to a new destination.
- Migrate friend groups & custom filters.
- Optional migration of single journal to group journal (aka community).

IN PROGRESS

- 200 lines of main()? Ugh. Clean up.
- Command line options for everything + usage info.

COMPLETED

- Generate html for comments along with each entry.
- Stop assuming LJ is source server in regexps etc.
- Notice if we already have a user pic and skip it.
- Archives for communities.
